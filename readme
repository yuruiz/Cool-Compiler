Steps:
Install packages (If you only intend to use the C++ version, you don't need the jdk).
For Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install flex bison build-essential csh openjdk-6-jdk libxaw7-dev libc6-i386
For Fedora:
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries"
sudo yum install bison flex csh
Make the /usr/class directory:
sudo mkdir /usr/class
Make the directory owned by you:
sudo chown $USER /usr/class
Go to /usr/class and download the tarball:
cd /usr/class
wget http://spark-university.s3.amazonaws.com/stanford-compilers/vm/student-dist.tar.gz
Untar:
tar -xf student-dist.tar.gz
If you want things exactly like the VMs:
Add a symlink to your home directory:
ln -s /usr/class/cs143/cool ~/cool
Add the bin directory to your $PATH environment variable. If you are using bash, add to your .profile (or .bash_profile, .bashrc etc. depending on your configuration; note that in Ubuntu have to log out and back in for this to take effect):
PATH=/usr/class/cs143/cool/bin:$PATH
You may want to prepend export to the above command, i.e. export PATH=....

************note*******************
spim" is 32-bit program, in 64-bit system it requires installing 32-bit "glibc" library. 
Because of heavy patching in order to run COOL assembly code (*.s) you have to use provided "spim" program, not any newer version available on the internet.
If xspim (the GUI version of spim) does not start up but only prints something like 
*-courier-medium-r-normal--12-*-75-*
on the console, you will need to install some missing fonts and add them to the font path of your X11, like so:
sudo apt-get install xfonts-75dpi xfonts-100dpi
xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi
***********************************

In Debian/ubuntu, the 32 bit glibc library is provided by the libc6-i386 package:
sudo apt-get install libc6-i386"
